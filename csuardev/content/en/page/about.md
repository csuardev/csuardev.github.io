### About me

I'm Csuardev, and I've been working as a software developer for over 5 years now. I've mainly worked as a backend developer, though I've also had to dabble in some frontend stuff, mostly related to internal maintenance screens (which explains my awful taste in design).

Over this time, my professional tech stack has been Java (in versions ranging from 1.5 to 17) with Spring as the framework. For databases, I've primarily worked with Oracle for relational and MongoDB for non-relational, though I've also worked with others like PostgreSQL and DynamoDB.

Currently, I'm mainly interested in backend development with Go, since I find it a very easy language to write and read coming from Java, which in many cases can be a bit verbose for writing things quickly. I'm also trying to be a bit more well-rounded, so I dedicate a little of my time to React on the frontend side. Besides this, I usually use Python as a scripting language that allows me to make my day-to-day life easier.

Beyond programming languages, I'm currently training in AWS as a cloud platform to develop projects on (I already use it in my job, but there are many services that I haven't had the opportunity to use).

### About this blog

In this blog, I write about things that I discover in my day-to-day life as a programmer, whether at work or working on my side projects. Topics you can usually find here are theese:

- Short, quick notes that allow me not to forget how to do specific things
- Opinions or use cases about some tool that I've recently discovered
- Step-by-step tutorials that I think I would have wanted when I was a junior dev
- More abstract/conceptual articles about software engineering (if I can find the thime )
### When I'm AFK

Apart from programming, I also dedicate time to other things (I'm a human being, not an AI). When I'm stuck with a problem, I usually turn to music as a way to disconnect and see things from another perspective. I play the guitar, and I have a piano that I bang on when I can, although I've never dedicated the time it deserves to learning to play for real.

Outside of my room I really like going to the countryside and enjoying time in the open air, whether alone or with my family.
